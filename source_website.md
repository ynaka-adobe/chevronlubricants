# CLAUDE.md – Project Rules for chevronlubricants

## Project context

- Source website:  https://www.chevronlubricants.com/
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/ynaka-adobe/chevronlubricants
- DA project: https://da.live/#/ynaka-adobe/chevronlubricants
- Purpose: Migrate selected pages from chevronlubricants.com into an Edge Delivery / DA project.

## File conventions

1. `source_website.md`
   - Canonical list of source URLs and migration scope.
   - Before planning or executing migration tasks, read this file and prefer URLs listed as in-scope.
   - Do not crawl or migrate URLs marked out-of-scope unless explicitly instructed.

2. `pr.md`
   - Single source of truth for pull request descriptions and status.
   - Before composing a PR description or summarizing changes, read and update `pr.md`.
   - Maintain “Open PRs” and “Merged PRs” sections with branch, status, and notes.

## General behavior

- Prefer editing existing Markdown files (`*.md`) rather than creating ad-hoc notes elsewhere.
- When in doubt about URLs or scope, consult `source_website.md` instead of guessing.
- When working on code or content destined for review, ensure `pr.md` has an up-to-date entry.
